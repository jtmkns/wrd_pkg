NOTE! This info file assumes you are familiar with the UNIX
terminal and basic commands and setup protocols.

Welcome to 'wrd': a python-based terminal program that prints
random scriptures. Scripture is randomly retrieved from an
imported list array. Has a search argument '-f' and other args for
list array and help info (see text below).

This program works for mac os 10.4 to 10.7 and has also worked on
debian linux variants. Python version 2.3 to 2.7 is required. Not
sure how it would work with python 3.* versions.

To install: Place the wrd-pkg directory in some logical place 
and create a symbolic link to the wrd executable in your path. 

You can also add the command 'wrd' to your .profile, .bash_profile,
.bashrc, etc to pop up a new scripture every time a new shell is
launched. Also works in a tcsh shell env.

The scripture list array located in the ./scriptures.py module 
can be edited (add/remove scriptures) as long as the python list
rules are followed.

Arguments:
No args = a single random scripture
-h = help
-l = list length (total number of scriptures)
-p = prints entire scripture list from ./scriptures.py
-f <pattern> = returns scripture matches based on <pattern>
NOTE - the '-f' arg is case insensitive

Final Note!: There is an included script named 'wd.sh' that
can be used to print more than one scripture at a time (up to 7X).
Install by making a copy of the script in your path and removing
the 'sh' extension.
